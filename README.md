# Student Productivity & Screen-Time Analysis (SQL Project)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between student screen time, study hours, sleep duration, and productivity levels using SQL. The aim of this project is to practice real-world data analysis concepts and strengthen SQL querying skills.

## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project is a synthetic (dummy) dataset created for educational and practice purposes. It simulates realistic student behavior such as daily screen time, sleep hours, study duration, and productivity scores. No real personal data was used.

## Objectives
- Analyze how screen time affects student productivity
- Categorize productivity levels using CASE statements
- Apply aggregation and grouping to derive insights
- Practice SQL for real-world analytical thinking

## Tools & Skills Used
- SQL
- CASE WHEN statements
- GROUP BY, ORDER BY
- Aggregate functions (AVG, COUNT)
- Data analysis & interpretation

## Key Analysis Performed
- Average productivity by screen time category
- Productivity classification (Low, Medium, High)
- Relationship between sleep hours and productivity
- Study time patterns across productivity levels

## Key Insights
Students with lower screen time and adequate sleep tend to show higher productivity levels. Excessive screen time often correlates with reduced study hours and lower productivity.

## Project Status
Completed – beginner-friendly SQL analysis project ready for portfolio and resume use.
